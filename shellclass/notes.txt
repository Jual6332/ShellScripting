# Linux Shell Scripting: A Project-Based Approach to Learning
# Justin Alvey
SSH stands for Secure SHell
The Network protocol used to connect to Linux
SSH client not insta,led by default on Windows
Git includes an SSH client

# In lecture 12, he skipped a step
#He went fro vagrant init jasonc/centos7
#straight to 
vagrant ssh
#But my machine doesn't allow this.
#The second step for my machine was:
vagrant up
# Then:
vagrant ssh

# File extension on a shell script is not significant like it is with windows files (.exe)
# - sharp
! - bang
#! - shebang

# File gets passed to bash:
/bin/bash <FILE_NAE>
And then bash executes the file

# Comments are not executed. They are just for us humans, to describe our productByCode
# With the exeception being the first line of a shell script

# Chmod - file permissions
# read = 4
# write = 2
# execute = 1
#7 is read, write, execute for owner of the file
#5 is read, execute for group
#5 is rread, execute for everyone else

# Dot (.) represents "this directory"
# cd . = same directory
# cd .. = move to parent directory
# / is dir separator

#./file.sh is equivalent to the full path:
#/vagrant/file.sh
# Permission denied if you do not have execute permission
# on a file and try to execute it

# Anytime there is a shell built-in, use type
# No need to specify full path
type -a echo # type all
# Find that echo is a shell builtin
help echo | less
man uptime # man short for manual or man pages
# q to exit man or less

# Variables are storage locations for data that have a name
# Capitalize all variables, this is best practice. 


# Lecture 13
type -a if
if is a shell command
help if
semi-colons can be used or newlines to break up the different parts of if statement.

sudo ./luser-demo02.sh 
Now the script prints that we are root

We are using newer syntax of double brackets for if statements.
Older syntax was single brackets
[ is a shell built-in and /usr/bin/[ is a comand on the Linux machine

If something is rquired for a script, check for it. Never assume things are the way you want them to be

# Lecture 14:
User DRY principle of software
Don't Repeat Yourself
ReUse variables so you don't have to add the same hard-coded variable times in the code. once will do, then reuse that variable.

# if a commmand is a shell built-in, you can use the help coand for ore info on the command. Otherwise use man (manpages or manual)

USER_NAME=$(id -un)
# This syntax is used to capture the output of a command
# Test if the command succeeded.


# ${?} is the result of the ost previously run comand in the script. So if we store the output of a comand in a variable, we can get that result
# using ${?}. Short-hand

# Usernames can be longer than 8 characters. When they are longer than 8 characters, they are shortened to dougsta+ (plus icon) in the list of processes
# Usernames in Linux are case sensitive
# Can use numbers in username. Cannot use any special characters

# su for switch user
su - einstein

# Lecture X:
!v to run the most recent command that starts with 'v'
Bang V

Use the number of nanaoseconds in epoch time (since 1970) to get a harder to crack password

What is a checksum? - dint' explain very well

limitString to limit the number of characters in a string to a specific amount in Impact
Example: limitString(new_string,string,250) // Limits to 250 chars and creates a new string called new_string with only this many chars

head -n 1 /etc/passwd
Prints first line of the /etc/passwd file
Same thing (old style):
head -1 /etc/passwd
n stands for number of lines
c stands for number of chars
head -c1 /etc/passwd
# Prints first char in file

# Lecture 19:
Bash requires an interpreter, like Python
Arguments are passed to a shell script. Variables are used inside the shell script
Path can change, it is not the same for every user in every system. Keep that in mind
echo ${PATH}
which command - shows the full path of (shell) commands.
Basename - strip directory and suffix from filenames
dirname - returns the directory path and removes filename

Arguments:
Inside the script they are parameters, outside they are arguments.
