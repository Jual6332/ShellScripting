# Linux Shell Scripting: A Project-Based Approach to Learning
# Justin Alvey
SSH stands for Secure SHell
The Network protocol used to connect to Linux
SSH client not insta,led by default on Windows
Git includes an SSH client

# In lecture 12, he skipped a step
#He went fro vagrant init jasonc/centos7
#straight to 
vagrant ssh
#But my machine doesn't allow this.
#The second step for my machine was:
vagrant up
# Then:
vagrant ssh

# File extension on a shell script is not significant like it is with windows files (.exe)
# - sharp
! - bang
#! - shebang

# File gets passed to bash:
/bin/bash <FILE_NAE>
And then bash executes the file

# Comments are not executed. They are just for us humans, to describe our productByCode
# With the exeception being the first line of a shell script

# Chmod - file permissions
# read = 4
# write = 2
# execute = 1
#7 is read, write, execute for owner of the file
#5 is read, execute for group
#5 is rread, execute for everyone else

# Dot (.) represents "this directory"
# cd . = same directory
# cd .. = move to parent directory
# / is dir separator

#./file.sh is equivalent to the full path:
#/vagrant/file.sh
# Permission denied if you do not have execute permission
# on a file and try to execute it

# Anytime there is a shell built-in, use type
# No need to specify full path
type -a echo # type all
# Find that echo is a shell builtin
help echo | less
man uptime # man short for manual or man pages
# q to exit man or less

# Variables are storage locations for data that have a name
# Capitalize all variables, this is best practice.
